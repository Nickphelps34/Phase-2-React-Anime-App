Choose Your Anime Adventure!

App built on React.js utilizing routes, components, forms, the following CRUD requests:
GET, POST, and DELETE.

This app allows the user to view the top 20 greatest anime series as selected by IMDB.

This app displays information pertaining to series production studio, number of seasons,
IMBD rating, series summary, image associated with series, and start and end date of series.

This app allows the user to input their own favorite anime series in their favorites section,
allows them to rate the series, and keep personal notes on the series. Users are able to add animes 
from the top 20 list to their favorite animes. 

The recommendations tab allows users to filter through the top 20 animes by genre. When filtered
the cards display the level of time commitment a user must put in to complete the series based on
the number of episodes. If the number of episodes is <= 12 it is a low commitment, if the number of
episodes is >= 13 and <= 100 it is a medium commitment, and anything greater than 100 episodes will 
be considered a high commitment.
